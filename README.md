Personal static website generated with Emacs and org-mode. I am in
debt to [Nicolas Petton's
article](https://nicolas.petton.fr/blog/blogging-with-org-mode.html)
for his very clear introduction to *blogging with org-mode* and his
neat website. A good starting point is also, as usual, the
[org-publish](https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html) section of
the Org manual and [this nice Worg
tutorial](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html).
